## Our Goal, one and only

Each one of us is privileged.

We can read, write, and speak English.

We do know that there are people who are struggling to learn Next.js, due to the language barrier.

That could've been us, or it could be someone next to us.

We have received help from the Next.js community by discussions, or the framework itself, and it is now our turn to help those people who are looking for help.

Until the day Vercel officially supports localization, we will be the ones who will help them, and our efforts will be remembered as part of the official localization document.
