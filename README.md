## Our Goal, the one and only

Each one of us is privileged.

We can read, write, and speak English.

We do know that there are people who are struggling to learn Next.js, due to the language barrier.

That could've been us, or it could be someone next to us.

We've benefited from the Next.js community, whether through discussions or the framework itself. Now, it's our turn to give back.

Until the day Vercel officially supports localization, we will be the ones who will help those in need, and our efforts will become the part of the official localization initiative.
