# Contributing

It is advisable for all repositories under the `[locale].nextjs.guide` project to use English as the primary language for development and discussions.

This practice helps reduce the occurrence of duplicate issues across the projects.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.0.0
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) >= 7.0.0
- Fork this repository
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm i

pnpm dev
```

Open the localhost (default as `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.

## Development - Docs

- All docs are located in the `docs` directory
- Translate the docs, following the translation guide of your working repository.

## Development - Web

`nextjs.guide` is built on top of [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) which supports the docs theme with Next.js and MDX out of the box.

We recommend you read the [Nextra docs](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start) first.
